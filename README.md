About
This project allows users to input a song's name, and the system will return recommendations of similar tracks. The recommendation engine is based on the lyrics, track name, artist name, and playlist information. The backend is powered by Flask and machine learning, specifically using the TfidfVectorizer and NearestNeighbors from scikit-learn.
